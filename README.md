This is a project utilizing Java classes to create a Tech Elevator themed RPG

To Do List:
1. Write unit tests to map out what the application is supposed to accomplish
2. Provide functionality for the different starting items
3. Fill out the "Enemy" class (this will be abstract) and create "Enemy" subclasses
4. Design random encounters using Math.random() - these encounters could include enemies designed in the "Enemy" subclasses
5. Redo the starting items to use an I/O file reading system with each item and its stats in a text file that the program can read
